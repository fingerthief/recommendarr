Recommendarr is a web application that generates personalized TV show and movie recommendations based on your Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, and Jellyfin libraries using AI.

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Get personalized TV show and movie suggestions based on your existing library
- **Sonarr & Radarr Integration**: Connects directly to your media servers to analyze your TV and movie collections
- **Plex & Jellyfin Integration**: Analyzes your watch history to provide better recommendations based on what you've actually watched
- **Flexible AI Support**: Works with OpenAI, local models (Ollama/LM Studio), or any OpenAI-compatible API
- **API Server**: Routes requests through a server-side proxy to avoid CORS issues, store credentials securely, and hide API keys
- **Customization Options**: Adjust recommendation count, model parameters, and more
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes based on your preference
- **Poster Images**: Displays media posters with fallback generation

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) instance with API access (for TV recommendations)
- [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) instance with API access (for movie recommendations)
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) or [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) instance with API access (for watch history analysis) - optional
- An OpenAI API key or any OpenAI-compatible API (like local LLM servers)
- Node.js (v14+) and npm for development

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

Using our pre-built Docker image is the quickest way to get started:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:80 \
  -v recommendarr_data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3030` in your browser.

Note: The `-v recommendarr_data:/app/server/data` parameter creates a Docker volume to persist your credentials between container restarts.

For more Docker options, see the [Docker Support](#-docker-support) section below.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git
cd recommendarr
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server and API server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Visit `http://localhost:3030` in your browser.

If you want to run only the frontend or API server individually:
```bash
# Frontend only
npm run serve

# API server only
npm run server
```

The API server stores credentials in the `server/data` directory by default.

## üêã Docker Support

### Option 1: Pull and Run Pre-built Image

The easiest way to run Recommendarr:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest

# Run the container with persistent data
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:80 \
  -v recommendarr_data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
```

### Option 2: Build and Run Locally

If you want to build the Docker image yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd recommendarr

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t recommendarr:local .

# Run the container with persistent data
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:80 \
  -v recommendarr_data:/app/server/data \
  recommendarr:local
```

### Option 3: Docker Compose

The repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file. For proper access from outside your network:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git

# Navigate to the project directory 
cd recommendarr

# Start with docker-compose (the containers will discover the host IP automatically)
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build the image from the local Dockerfile and start the service on port 3030.

**Note for external access**: If you plan to access Recommendarr from outside your network, make sure to:
1. Forward ports 3030 and 3050 on your router to your server
2. When connecting to Sonarr/Radarr, use their local IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.0.x:8989)
3. Make sure your Sonarr/Radarr services are running when you try to connect

## üñ•Ô∏è Server API Features

Recommendarr includes a built-in API server that provides several important features:

1. **API Proxy**: Avoids CORS issues when connecting to media servers
2. **Credential Storage**: Securely stores all your API keys and connection details
3. **Session Persistence**: Maintains your connections between browser sessions
4. **Security**: Keeps sensitive credentials out of client-side JavaScript
5. **Centralized Management**: Provides a single place to manage all service connections

The API server:
- Automatically starts with the `npm run dev` command
- Is included in the Docker image
- Stores credentials in the `server/data` directory by default
- Uses encrypted storage for sensitive information

When using Docker, make sure to create a volume mount for `/app/server/data` to persist your credentials between container restarts.

## ü§ñ Compatible AI Services

Recommendarr works with various AI services:

- **OpenAI API**: Standard integration with models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- **Ollama**: Self-hosted models with OpenAI-compatible API
- **LM Studio**: Run models locally on your computer
- **Anthropic Claude**: Via OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Self-hosted models**: Any service with OpenAI-compatible chat completions API
