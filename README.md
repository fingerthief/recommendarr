## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Hub Image (Easiest)

The simplest way to get started with Recommendarr:

```bash
# Pull and run with default port 3000
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v recommendarr-data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest

# Or run with a custom port (e.g., 8080)
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v recommendarr-data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` (or your custom port) in your browser.

**Default Login:** 
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `1234`

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Please change your password immediately after your first login for security reasons.

### Option 2: Docker Compose

If you prefer using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository (which includes the docker-compose.yml file)
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git
cd recommendarr

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
1. Pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub
2. Configure proper networking and persistence
3. Start the unified service

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` (or your custom port if configured) in your browser.

You can customize the port by setting the PORT environment variable before running docker-compose:

```bash
PORT=8080 docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Build Your Own Docker Image

If you want to build the Docker image yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git
cd recommendarr

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t recommendarr:local .

# Run the container with default port
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v recommendarr-data:/app/server/data \
  recommendarr:local

# Or run with custom port
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v recommendarr-data:/app/server/data \
  recommendarr:local
```

### Option 4: Manual Installation

- Randomly generated
- Kept secret

Generate one using:
```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
openssl rand -hex 32
```

#### Setting Up OAuth Providers

1. **Create OAuth Applications**:
   - **Google**:
     1. Go to [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
     2. Create a new project
     3. Navigate to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth client ID"
     4. Select "Web application" type
     5. Add authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs (see below)
   
   - **GitHub**:
     1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
     2. Click "New OAuth App"
     3. Fill in application details
     4. Set callback URL (see below)

2. **Configure Callback URLs**:
   The callback URL must match exactly with what you configure in the OAuth provider:
   ```
   {PUBLIC_URL}/api/auth/{provider}/callback
   ```
   Where:
   - `{PUBLIC_URL}` is your Recommendarr's public URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com`)
   - `{provider}` is either `google` or `github`

   Example callback URLs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback`
   - Production: `https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com/api/auth/github/callback`

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Add these to your docker-compose.yml or .env file:
   ```bash
   # Required for all OAuth providers
   SESSION_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here

   # Google OAuth
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

   # GitHub OAuth
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

   # Public URL (must match callback URL domain)
   PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Or your production domain
   ```

4. **Restart the Application**:
   After setting the environment variables, restart Recommendarr for changes to take effect.

5. **Verify OAuth Login**:
   - Visit the login page - you should see Google/GitHub login buttons
   - Test the login flow with each provider
   - Check server logs for any authentication errors

> **Important Notes**:
> - The SESSION_SECRET should remain the same across restarts or users will be logged out
> - For production, set `FORCE_SECURE_COOKIES=true` when using HTTPS
> - OAuth users are created with regular privileges by default (admins can promote them)
> - If changing PUBLIC_URL, you must update the callback URLs in your OAuth provider settings

### 4. Get Recommendations

1. Navigate to TV Recommendations or Movie Recommendations page
2. Adjust the number of recommendations you'd like to receive using the slider
3. If connected to Plex, Jellyfin, or Tautulli, choose whether to include your watch history in the recommendations
4. Click "Get Recommendations"
5. View your personalized media suggestions with posters and descriptions

## üåê Setting Up with a Reverse Proxy

If you want to run Recommendarr behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy), follow these steps:

1. Build a custom image with your public URL:

```bash
# Build with your public URL
docker build -t recommendarr:custom \
  --build-arg PUBLIC_URL=https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com \
  --build-arg BASE_URL=/ \
  .

# Run with reverse proxy configuration
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e PUBLIC_URL=https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com \
  -e FORCE_SECURE_COOKIES=true \
  -v recommendarr-data:/app/server/data \
  recommendarr:custom
```

2. Configure your reverse proxy to forward requests to Recommendarr:

**For Nginx:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name recommendarr.yourdomain.com;

    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

**For Docker Compose:**

```yaml
services:
  recommendarr:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - PUBLIC_URL=https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com
        - BASE_URL=/
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    # This allows accessing services on the host machine
    # extra_hosts:
    #  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DOCKER_ENV=false
      - PORT=3000
      - PUBLIC_URL=https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com
      # Enable secure cookies when behind HTTPS reverse proxy
      - FORCE_SECURE_COOKIES=true
    volumes:
      - recommendarr-data:/app/server/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  recommendarr-data:
```

## üîß Environment Variables

## üñ•Ô∏è Compatible AI Services

Recommendarr works with various AI services:

- **OpenAI API**: Standard integration with models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- **Ollama**: Self-hosted models with OpenAI-compatible API
- **LM Studio**: Run models locally on your computer
- **Anthropic Claude**: Via OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Self-hosted models**: Any service with OpenAI-compatible chat completions API

### Recommended Models

Here are some recommendations for models that work well with Recommendarr:

#### Free/Low-Cost Options via OpenRouter
- **Meta Llama 3.3 70B Instruct**: Great performance for free
- **Gemini 2.0 models** (Flash/Pro/Thinking): Excellent recommendation quality
- **DeepSeek R1 models**: Strong performance across variants

#### Premium Models (Affordable via OpenRouter)
- **Claude 3.7/3.5 Haiku**: Exceptional for understanding your library preferences
- **GPT-4o mini**: Excellent balance of performance and cost
- **Grok Beta**: Good recommendations at reasonable prices
- **Amazon Nova Pro**: Strong media understanding capabilities

#### Local Models
- **DeepSeek R1 7B Qwen Distill**: Good performance for a smaller model (via LM Studio)

For best results, try setting max tokens to 4000 and temperature between 0.6-0.8 depending on the model.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Cookie Errors with Reverse Proxy

If you're using a reverse proxy with HTTPS and get errors like:
```
cookie "auth_token" has been rejected because a non-https cookie can't be set "secure"
```

This happens when your reverse proxy terminates HTTPS but forwards the request to the container as HTTP. To fix this:

1. Add the `FORCE_SECURE_COOKIES=true` environment variable to your docker-compose.yml or docker run command:
```yaml
environment:
  - FORCE_SECURE_COOKIES=true
```

2. Make sure your reverse proxy forwards the correct headers. For Nginx, add:
```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

### Port Mapping

- Always make sure the internal and external ports match (e.g., 3000:3000)
- When changing ports, update both the port mapping and PORT environment variable

### Development Setup

For development purposes, you can run the frontend and backend separately:

```bash
# Run both frontend and backend in development mode
npm run dev

# Or run them separately:
# Frontend dev server with hot reloading
npm run serve

# Backend API server
npm run api
```

The development server will use port 8080 for the frontend with hot reloading, and port 3050 for the API. In production, both run on a single port.
